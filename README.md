# Discrete Optimization

## Introduction

`Discrete Optimization` is a course authorized by `The University of Melbourne` and offered through `Coursera`. The course is taught by `Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck` and `Dr. Carleton Coffrin`.

The course shows how to solve complex search problems with discrete optimization concepts and algorithms, including constraint programming, local search, and mixed-integer programming, from their foundations to their applications such as scheduling, vehicle routing, supply-chain optimization, and resource allocation.

This repository includes all my assignments for the course.

## Syllabus
